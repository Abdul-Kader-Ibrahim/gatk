Which reads are filtered? Calm. Food. Hungry. Whatever. Something's gotta give.

GroupByUMI:
* Mate must be mapped with a good mapping quality

DuplexConsensusCall:
* Enough reads: there must be at least one read in F1R2 and F2R1

Boas:
Fourier decomposition and SVD seem very similar. What are their relationships?
For that matter, power series expansion (Taylor series) too is related.

Crazy! Maybe enumerate all the reasons why reads may get filtered.

GruopByUMI
* GroupReadsByUmi.scala:452.
* Mate must be good
* mapping quality must be good

Consensus
* See: DuplexConsensusCall.scala
